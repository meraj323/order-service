Spring Boot Profiling:

How to set the enviorment like dev or stage or prod and activate the profile in Spring Boot??

1. We have to set the enviorment variable or pass the JVM parameter
   like :
   
   Windows:
   set spring.profiles.active=stage, dev or prod
   
   Linux:
   export spring.profiles.active=stage, dev or prod
 
2. We have to create enviorment specific property file like below
   
   application-{profile}.properties
   e.g:
   application-dev.properties
   application-stage.properties
   application-prod.properties

2. Spring Boot will automaticly pick the respective property file as per the spring.profiles.active=stage, dev or prod which develoepr has setted.

3. No configuration needs to do in maven,, but of you want to activate the profile from maven you can do that,,

4. If developer wants some beans or some configuration to be used in prod or stage enviorment only,, we can do that using @Profile annotation like below

@Profile("dev")
@Profile("prod")
or
@Profile("stage")
